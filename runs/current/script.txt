"From cavemen to skyscrapers—human progress isn’t linear, it’s a rocket accelerating into the unknown. Take a man from 1750 to 2015, and he’d collapse from shock—cars, planes, the internet—a world of sorcery. But bring someone from 1500 to 1750? Barely a flinch. Progress exploded after the Industrial Revolution, and now, AI is the next leap. Vernor Vinge warned this change rivals the rise of life itself. The future? A blur of AI cities, human-robot symbiosis—and a question: can we handle the shock of what’s next?" (Pacing: Fast, urgent. Hits all visual beats—evolution timeline, time-travel shock, Industrial Revolution, AI futurism. 70 words, ~35 sec.)
